# Bromies
A full-stack twitter clone built using React on the front-end, Node.js with Express on the back-end, and MongoDB as the database. The app is currently up and running as of May 15, 2020, and was deployed using heroku.

Features include: <br>
* Writing and posting brotes (tweets!) instantly
* Live database updating/fast page rendering on submission
* Live database statistics
* Liking and unliking a brote
* Infinite scrolling

I created this application to educate myself on web development, as I have never done anything like this before. I taught myself how to create responsive pages on the client side using React, and how to read and write APIs on my server through Node.js. I also wanted to learn how to perform CRUD operations with an online database, and how to use this to serve my application. I finally managed to deploy my app online, and learned how to read website logs and how to maintain my MongoDB cluster.
